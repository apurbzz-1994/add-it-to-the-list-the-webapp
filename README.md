# add-it-to-the-list-the-webapp
A webapp that helps you organize and keep track of all the recommendations your friends keep imposing on you.
This project is inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89gkCNQAtNA&t=187s) comedy sketch.

> When a friend recommends a new show, book or podcast... do you add it to the list?
